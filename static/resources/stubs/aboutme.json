    "description": "I'm a web developer who's been self-learning to code since Spring of 2018. I was fortunate enough to have been raised in a family that was into computers early on which allowed me access to computers around the young age of 7. Fastfoward about 13 years and I started looking for technical support jobs with more of a customer service role. Eventually, I ended up in an Associate Desktop Engineer position for several years. I wanted to automate portions of my work load which lead me to start messing around with PowerShell scripts. I instantly got sucked in to creating scripts, getting them to work with our systems, and then refactoring them to make them even more efficient. I quickly realized that this was the most fun I'd had at work and knew it was definitely something I would become passionate about. Now I'm aiming for the cliche of turning what I love into my carreer, and am hoping to offically transition into a web development position in the near future."
