    "items": "I'm a web developer who's been self-learning to code since Spring of 2018. I was fortunate enough to be raised in a family that was into computers which allowed me access to computers around the age of 7. Fast-forward about 13 years and I started looking for technical support jobs with more of a customer service role. Eventually, I ended up in an Associate Desktop Engineer position which I've been doing for several years. While in this position I wanted to automate portions of my workload which lead me to working with PowerShell scripts. I instantly got hooked on creating scripts, getting them to work with our systems, and refactoring them to improve efficiency. I realized it was the most fun I'd had at work and it became something I am very passionate about. Now I'm aiming for the clich√© of turning what I love into my career, and am hoping to officially transition into a web development position in the near future."
